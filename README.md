## Demo Summaries

### 1. Bootstrap Demo (`bootstrap-demo`)

**Approach:**  

- Used Bootstrap's component-based system CDN  
- Created responsive layout with:  
  - Navigation bar  
  - 2-column grid system  
  - Pre-styled button and alert components  

**Key Features Implemented:**  
✔ Navbar with responsive collapse  
✔ Equal-width columns that stack on mobile  
✔ Button with hover effects  
✔ Alert box with warning style  

**Experience:**  
  via
"My experince with Bootstrap was enjoyable. It makes it easy to create professional-looking components quickly. The grid system was intuitive for responsive layouts, though customizing beyond the predefined styles felt limiting."

### 2. Tailwind CSS Demo (`tailwind-demo/`)  

**Approach:**  

- Used utility-first classes via CDN  
- Built responsive card components with:  
  - Dynamic grid columns (1 → 2 → 3 across breakpoints)  
  - Custom-styled buttons with hover transitions  

**Key Features Implemented:**  
✔ Responsive card grid (`grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`)  
✔ Image cards with consistent aspect ratio  
✔ Buttons with color utilities and hover states  
✔ Shadow and rounded corners on cards  

**Experience:**
Tailwind's utility classes enabled pixel-perfect control without writing CSS. The responsive prefixes (like 'md:') were powerful but required memorizing many class names. The workflow felt faster once familiar with the syntax.

### 3. React.js Demo (`react-demo/` or CodeSandbox)  

**Approach:**  

- Created functional components using:
  - Props for the welcome message  
  - useState hook for toggle functionality  

**Key Features Implemented:**  
✔ Component with props (`WelcomeMessage`)  
✔ State management for toggle visibility  
✔ Conditional rendering of message  
✔ Inline button styling  

**Experience:**  
[Share your React observations. Example:]  
"React's component model made the UI logic more organized. The useState hook simplified state management compared to vanilla JS. JSX felt natural for mixing HTML and JavaScript."

## Comparative Analysis  

**Bootstrap vs. Tailwind:**  

- Bootstrap: Faster for standard components, but harder to customize  
- Tailwind: More flexible styling, but requires learning many utility classes  

**React Observations:**  

- Declarative approach made state changes more predictable  
- Component reuse would scale well for larger applications  

## Completed Features  

All required features from the lab instructions were implemented:  

- Bootstrap: Navbar, grid, button, alert  
- Tailwind: Responsive cards with images/buttons  
- React: Props, state management, conditional rendering
